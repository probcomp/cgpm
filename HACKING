Notes For cgpm Hackers

* Branches

Should be [year][month][day]-[username]-[branch-description...], for example a
well named branch is 20160621-fsaad-update-hacking.

Please do not delete branches, history should be maintained.

* Python coding style

Generally follow PEP 8, 80-char max, with these exceptions:

- New line, instead of alignment, for continuation lines. For function
definitions, no new line and use eight spaces.

    Example: Yes
    model = cgpm.crosscat.state.State(
        X, outputs=[1,2,3,4], inputs=None,
        cctypes=['normal', 'bernoulli', 'poisson', 'lognormal'],
        rng=np.random.RandomState(0))

    Example: No
    model = cgpm.crosscat.state.State(X, outputs=[1,2,3], inputs=None,
                                      cctypes=['normal', 'bernoulli', 'poisson',
                                        'lognormal'],
                                      rng=np.random.RandomState(0))

    Example: Yes, Preferred
    def generate_mh_sample(
            x, logpdf_target, jump_std, D, num_samples=1,
            num_burn=1, num_chains=7 num_lag=1, rng=None):
        ...body...

    Example: Yes
    def generate_mh_sample(x, logpdf_target, jump_std, D, num_samples=1,
            num_burn=1, num_chains=7 num_lag=1, rng=None):
        ...body...

    Example: No
    def generate_mh_sample(x, logpdf_target, jump_std, D, num_samples=1,
                           num_burn=1, num_chains=7 num_lag=1, rng=None):
        ...body...

- Generally use single-quoted strings, except use """ for doc strings.

* Python imports

Should be organized as follows:

    [standard library imports]
    - blank line -
    [third-party library imports]
    - blank line -
    [sister projects library imports]
    - blank line -
    [cgpm module imports]

Each import block should be organized alphabetically: first all unqualified
imports (import baz), then all named imports (from foo import nix).
For example

import math
import multiprocessing as mp

from array import ArrayType
from struct import pack

import numpy as np

from scipy.misc import logsumexp
from scipy.stats import geom
from scipy.stats import norm

import bayeslite.core
import bayeslite.math_util

from gpmcc.crosscat.state import State
from gpmcc.utils import general as gu

* Testing

The tip of every branch merged into master __must__ pass ./check.sh, and be
consistent with the code conventions here. New functionality must always be
associated with test -- fixing bugs should preferably include a test as well
(less strict).

* Entropy

Please, never, ever used global random state. Every source of random bits must
be managed explicitly.
