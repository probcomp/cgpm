abstract="Although hirundines have been used extensively in homing experiments,
to date no investigation of their migratory orientation has been carried out,
despite the well-known migratory habits of many species of this family. This
paper reports on a study of the orientation of the barn swallow (Hirundo
rustica), a typical diurnal trans-Saharan migrant. Modified Emlen funnels were
used to verify the suitability of this species for cage experiments and
investigate the role of visual and magnetic cues during the birds' first
migratory journey. Juvenile swallows were mist-netted at a roost site in central
Italy and then tested in a site 19Â km apart. Orientation experiments were
performed under four experimental conditions: natural clear sky and simulated
overcast, in both local and shifted magnetic fields (magnetic North=geographical
West). Under clear sky, the swallows tended to orient phototactically toward the
best-lit part of the funnel and failed to respond to the magnetic field shift.
Under overcast conditions, they oriented northward and modified their
directional choices as expected in response to the shifted magnetic North. On
the whole, our data indicate that swallows can use magnetic information for
compass orientation. Possible explanations for the northward orientation of
birds tested under overcast conditions are discussed.",
