# cgpm

The aim of this project is to provide a unified probabilistic programming
framework to express different models and techniques from statistics, machine
learning and non-parametric Bayes.

Conditional generative population models (CGPM) provide a computational
abstraction for probabilistic objects. They provide an interface that explicitly
differentiates between the _sampler_ of a random variable from its conditional
distribution and the _assessor_ of its conditional density. By encapsulating
models as probabilistic programs that implement CGPMs, complex models can be
built as compositions of sub-CGPMs.

## Installing
```
pip install .
```

## Static Example

The simplest example is creating a synthetic dataset where each variable is a
mixture of one of the available DistributionGpms. Inference is run using
[gpmcc](src/crosscat), an extended implementation of
[crosscat](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/crosscat/) from the lens of
compositions of conditional generative population models.

```
$ python -i examples/one_view.py
```

A plot similar to ![images/one_view.png](images/one_view.png) should appear.

## Interactive Example (Experimental)

Single-particle SMC in a DP Mixture with Normal-InverseGamma base measure and
normal obervations can be run interactively:

```
$ cd experiments/univariate_crp
$ python -i crp.py
```

Click on the graph to produce observations and watch, the Gibbs kernel cycle
through the hypothesis space

![images/smc.gif](images/smc.gif)

The values printed in the console after each click are estimates of the
marginal-log-likelihood of observations, based on the single particle
weight. The following output

```
Observation 8.000000: 0.209677
[-8.0740236375201153]
```

means the eighth observation is 0.209677, and the estimated marginal
log-liklelihood is -8.0740236375201153.

## Tests

Running `./check.sh` will run a subset of the tests that are considered complete
and stable. To launch the full test suite, including continuous integration
tests, run `py.test` in the root directory. There are more tests in the `tests/`
directory, but those that do not start with `test_` or do start with `disabled_`
are not considered ready. The tip of every branch merged into master __must__
pass `./check.sh`, and be consistent with the code conventions outlined in
HACKING.
